# zikzak\_inappwebview\_macos

The Apple macOS WKWebView implementation of [`zikzak_inappwebview`](https://pub.dev/packages/zikzak_inappwebview).

## Usage

This package is [endorsed](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages#endorsed-federated-plugin),
which means you can simply use `zikzak_inappwebview`
normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do,
so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you
should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.
